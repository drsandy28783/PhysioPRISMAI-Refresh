PhysiologicPRISM is a healthcare technology company that provides cloud-based Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and practice management software specifically designed for physiotherapy clinics and practitioners. Our platform leverages artificial intelligence powered by Azure OpenAI GPT-4o to assist physiotherapists in creating comprehensive clinical documentation, including initial assessments, SOAP notes, progress reports, and discharge summaries. The system stores unlimited patient records, manages appointments and sessions, generates professional PDF reports, and provides practice analytics—all while maintaining HIPAA compliance through Microsoft Azure's healthcare-grade infrastructure. We serve solo practitioners, small clinics, and large hospital networks through flexible subscription plans, operating in India with expansion into international markets including the United States, Europe, and Australia.

### For Investor/Partnership Pitches:

PhysiologicPRISM is revolutionizing physiotherapy practice management by combining traditional EMR functionality with cutting-edge AI clinical decision support. Unlike conventional EMR systems that simply store data, our platform actively assists physiotherapists in delivering better patient outcomes by generating evidence-based treatment recommendations, automating documentation workflows, and providing actionable insights through advanced analytics. Built on Microsoft Azure with full HIPAA compliance, we serve the $40+ billion global physiotherapy market with a scalable SaaS model that addresses the critical pain points of documentation burden (which consumes 40% of clinicians' time) and inconsistent treatment protocols. Our AI-powered approach reduces documentation time by 60%, ensures clinical consistency, and allows practitioners to focus on patient care rather than paperwork. With tiered pricing from solo practitioners ($29/month USD) to large hospital networks ($299/month USD), we're positioned to capture market share across the full spectrum of physiotherapy practice sizes.
