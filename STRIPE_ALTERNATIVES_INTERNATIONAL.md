## 💡 TAX HANDLING WITH PADDLE

**The Magic:** Paddle is Merchant of Record

**What this means:**
- Customer in Germany buys $79 plan
- Paddle automatically adds 19% VAT = $94.01 total
- Paddle collects the payment
- Paddle remits VAT to German government
- **You get:** $79 minus Paddle fee
- **You do:** NOTHING for tax compliance

**Without Paddle (e.g., with 2Checkout):**
- You need to register for VAT in EU (if >€10K sales)
- You file quarterly VAT returns in 27 EU countries
- You handle tax compliance in USA (state sales tax)
- **OR** hire accountant for $500-1000/month

**Paddle saves you:** $6K-12K/year in accounting fees + 100+ hours

---

**Fees:** 5% + $0.50 (vs Stripe's 2.9% + $0.30)
