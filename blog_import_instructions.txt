# Blog Import from GCP Deployment

This directory contains scripts to import the 3 comprehensive blog posts from the GCP deployment into Cosmos DB.

## Blog Posts Included

1. **Clinical Reasoning in Physiotherapy: The Complete 2025 Guide**
   - Comprehensive guide covering reasoning models, differential diagnosis, ICF framework, and AI support
   - File: `import_blog_1.py`

2. **History Taking in Physiotherapy: The Complete 2025 Guide**

## How to Import

### Option 1: Import All Blogs at Once (Recommended)

Run the master import script on your Azure deployment:

```bash
python import_all_blogs.py
```

This will import all 3 blog posts in sequence.

### Option 2: Import Individual Blogs

Run each script separately:

```bash
python import_blog_1.py  # Clinical Reasoning
python import_blog_2.py  # History Taking
python import_blog_3.py  # Objective Assessment
```

## Requirements

- Must be run on Azure deployment where Cosmos DB credentials are available
- Scripts will NOT work locally without Cosmos DB connection
- Requires `azure_cosmos_db.py` module

## After Import

Once imported, the blogs will be available at:
- `/blog` - Blog list page
- Homepage carousel (if configured)
- `/admin/blog` - Admin management page (super admin only)

## Technical Details

- All scripts migrated from Firebase/Firestore to Cosmos DB
- HTML content preserved exactly from GCP deployment
- Includes complete styling and formatting
- Blog posts marked as `status: 'published'`
- Publication dates set to import time

## Troubleshooting

If import fails:
1. Ensure you're running on Azure deployment
2. Check Cosmos DB credentials are configured in environment variables
3. Verify `blog_posts` collection exists in Cosmos DB
4. Check error messages for specific issues
