  <h2>Understanding Our Policy</h2>
  <p>PhysiologicPRISM is a <strong>Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)</strong> platform that provides immediate access to cloud-based tools, AI-powered features, and data storage upon subscription. Due to the nature of digital services and instant access provided, <strong>we do not offer refunds for any subscription fees paid</strong>.</p>

  <h2>Why No Refunds?</h2>
  <p>As a SaaS platform, we provide:</p>
  <ul>

    <li><strong>Consumable Resources:</strong> AI credits, server resources, and storage are consumed as you use the service</li>
    <li><strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> Access to proprietary algorithms, frameworks, and clinical tools</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Once these digital services are delivered and resources consumed, they cannot be "returned" like physical products.</p>
